# Leiva, the definitive low-level programming language
### Download & Installation
There are not actual releases, since this language is a prototype. 

### Examples
#### Hello World:
```rs
fn main()
  println("Hello World!!!");
;
```
A hipotetical new programming language. Syntax and functions are prototypes.
