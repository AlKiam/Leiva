# Leiva, the definitive low-level programming language
### Download & Installation
There are not actual releases, since this language is a prototype. 

### Examples
#### Hello World:
```rust
fn main() {
  println!("");
}
```
A hipotetical new programming language. Syntax and functions are prototypes.
